# Final Project for Lexical and Syntax Analysis (INF1022)

This final project consists in using the **Flex/Bison (Lex/Yacc)** toolkit to generate compilers with
the intention to generate code from an imperative language (Provol-One) in a Turing Machine. The
Turing Machines are generated according to a XML dialect that will be later on interpreted by the
**JFLAP Java application**. These macros work as a sort of runtime system to the generated code. The
generated code can be aimed either for TMs with a single tape or for TMs with multiple tapes - it
is totally up to us to decide the model. Either way, the goal of this project is to apply the
concepts learned on the INF1022 course, lectured by the professor Edward Hermann Haeusler.
